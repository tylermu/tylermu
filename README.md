Hi, i'm Tyler. I studied computer science at the U of St. Thomas (MN), and am currently working as a FT Software Developer! In my freetime I (when motivation strikes lol) work on personal coding projects. You can check out some of them below :)

### University Book Fetch System: https://github.com/tylermu/UniversityBookFetchSystem

This program was created as a database management system. It is built to contain lots of information about universities, classes, teachers, and then associated books with those classes or teachers. Students can use this sytem to look up books for the classes they are enrolling in, in order to buy the books they need. 

### Blink Detection: https://github.com/tylermu/BlinkDetection

This program was created as part of a research job, with the end goal of detecting deception in speech by tracking facial movements. This project stood as the first part of the overall goal, and with this project we wanted to track blink rate of a face infront of a camera. THe program can be fed live imagery or video files. 

### Crime Map: https://github.com/tylermu/CrimeMap

This program was created to gain insights into web development, and database management. This program, which has lots of features, is able to plot crimes from a database on a google maps view of St. Paul, MN. You can interact with the plotted crimes, delete crimes, add new ones. The program communicates with a API we made, in order to recieve JSON data. The API is also cors-enabled in order to allow deletion and insertion into the database via the API.
